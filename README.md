## Use at your own risk
###### Patches developed and offered only for the last, stable line (not EOL). 
###### Active support is offered only for this kernel line. 
###### Any others are not supported anymore, but you can find patchsets for previous versions of kernel in "archive" directory. 
###### The patchset not includes upstream bugfixes patches from kernel line 4.XX. 
###### You should applied them on your own. It should be possible to applied patchset on any supported version of kernel, but I personally support only the last possible version of kernel from stable branch.
###### The patchset contains various patches developed by their authors, always in the newest versions and sometimes with fixes from master branch or from the other authors when it's necessary.
